# Secrecy of an IRS Assisted Two-Way Communication System

- This is a  project investigating the exploitation of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to communicate securely in a two-way communication system consisting of an untrusted user.
- I developed a semi-definite programming based alternating optimization algorithm to maximize the sum-secrecy of the system.
- The proposed algorithm yielded gains reaching 120\% compared to partially optimized schemes.
- To run the code please install cvx (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) and mosek solver (https://www.mosek.com/) and run the algo1.m file.
